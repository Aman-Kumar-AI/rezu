      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I am a Senior AI & Full-Stack Engineer with over 3 years of experience building enterprise-scale, production-ready applications across frontend, backend, cloud, and AI systems.
        <br /><br />
        I currently work at Coforge, where I design and deliver AI-powered platforms using Angular for frontend, Django & FastAPI for backend services, SQL Server for data processing, and Azure AI & Vertex AI for integrating Large Language Models into real-world business workflows. I have successfully built and integrated 50+ APIs and an equivalent number of optimized stored procedures, ensuring high performance, scalability, and reliability.
        <br /><br />
        Previously at HCL Technologies, I focused on Generative AI and Data Science, where I worked on resume classification and ranking systems using Gemini LLMs, built fine-tuned chatbots, and implemented prompt-engineered AI solutions.
        <br /><br />
        Across my journey, I have consistently applied SOLID principles, clean architecture, and system-level optimizations to reduce development timelines, improve maintainability, and enhance system performance.
